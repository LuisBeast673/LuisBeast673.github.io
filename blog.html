          <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Get Admin Rights on School or Work Computer:</h1>

          <p>This is the easiest way to get Admin rights on a school PC (or any PC that you don't have admin rights on). No Windows 10 installation, or the fake method: set_COMPAT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker. Not sure if you guys have heard of that method, but it only works for games like Steam because it's not running as Admin, it's just trying to bypass UAC (User Account Control, which is where it says, "Do you want this app to make changes to your device?). Most apps like Bluestacks thought about that, so they made and executable file that automatically runs the installer inside of the executable file. That causes you to be unable to bypass UAC because you would still need to bypass UAC for the actual installer. Not to mention, you can't edit Bluestacks code since they have all of the permissions. Okay, enough talking, here's the point:</p>

          <p>Before you do this, make sure you have a USB drive, that is very essential for this tutorial.</p>

          <p>1. Go to your browser's extension settings. On Chrome just type, "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar.</p>

          <p>2. In the top right hand corner, switch "developer mode" to the ON position.</p>

          <p>3. Click on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank">this</a> link to get you to your first download:  Don't worry, you wont be installing another Windows 10 OS: Direct Link Here. YOU DO NOT NEED ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS TO DOWNLOAD THIS FILE!!!</p>

          <p>4. Do this shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + I. In the window that just popped up, there is also three dots in the top right hand corner, click it. After that, click "More tools > Network conditions." You'll see another windows pop up in the bottom. Where it says "User Agent," untick "Select automatically." In the drop down below that, select "Blackberry - BB10." Then refresh the page.</p>

          <p>5. You'll notice that the website changed. You can click out of the window on the right (yeah, the one we opened earlier). Where is says, "Select Edition," choose the latest version of Windows 10, and click confirm. Then select your product language, in my case, that is English of course. Then click 64-bit download. You will see that a ".iso" file will download. You may need to wait a little for it to download.</p>

          <p>6. Assuming that you finished downloading the ".iso" file, go to <a href="https://portableapps.com/download" target="_blank">this</a> link. YOU DO NOT NEED ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS TO DOWNLOAD THIS FILE EITHER!!! Once you get to the website, click the big green button where it says "Download."</p>

          <p>7. Once you download it, double click it and go through all of the installation procedures (This one is 100% safe too), it only takes about a minute. Once you've done that, run the app, it should be called "Start.exe." Then, at the right of the little windows the pops up, click "apps." Then, click "Get More Apps... > By category" Scroll down until you find the "Utilities" category. Look for an app called "7-Zip." It's a file manager which we will use to extract the ".iso" file we downloaded earlier. Go through the installation procedures, which you don't need admin privileges for.</p>

          <p>8. After you installed "7-Zip," run it. Go to the folder where you installed the ".iso" file. Insert your USB drive as well. MAKE SURE THE USB DRIVE IS FORMATTED TO "NTFS" You can do this by going to file explorer. Right click your USB drive, click format, and where it says "file type," (It's probably going to be on the FAT32 option which is the default one) click NTFS, and make sure to not change any other settings. Then, click "Format." Go back to 7-Zip, right click the file, then click "7-Zip > Extract files..." It will ask you to choose a directory. Choose your USB drive.</p>

          <p>9. After you did it, click the up arrow in the task bar, then right click the button that looks like a USB drive, and click "eject" to pull out your USB drive safely, without corrupting any files.</p>

          <p>10. Now, turn off your computer, and plug your USB drive in again. Now turn on your computer while spamming your BIOS key really fast. It's usually Esc, Delete, or one of the Function keys, mine was F12. If it asks you for a password (most likely not, since most teachers don't know how to use BIOS settings), you are screwed. You would have to take the battery out of your motherboard, and wait 40 seconds, then put the battery back in, in order to reset the password (you can't do that in school obviously). If it doesn't have a password, you're in luck. Use arrow keys to scroll and "Enter" to select. Scroll down to where it says something like "BIOS settings." BIOS settings are very different from each other, but where it says something like TTP or PTM, disable both of them, or one of them if you only have one of them. Then, look for something like "Safe Boot," somewhere else in the settings, it might not be in "Security." After you found it, disable it. Then look for something like "Legacy Boot Mode," it should be in the "General" tab, then enable it. Then click "apply" and "Okay."</p>

          <p>11. Your PC will probably reboot again, and go to the BIOS settings again. Where is says something like, "USB, or USB mass storage device," scroll down to it, and press "Enter." It should lead you to the installation of Windows 10. Press "Shift + F10" which should open the Command Prompt. Type "Notepad" and press "Enter." Go to "File > Open," and look for the drive where you installed windows (probably C:\ or D:\), and double click it. Then go to "Windows > System32." Find a file named "Utilman." Right click it, and click "rename." Rename it to "Utilman2," and click enter. You may notice that nothing happened, but if you press "F5," and scroll down, you'll see that it changed (F5 is refresh). Scroll down to "CMD." Right click it, then click "copy." Then do Ctrl + V, and press F5 again. Scroll to where it says "CMD - copy," and rename it to "Utilman." Press F5 one more time, then reboot your PC and DON'T LOGIN.</p>

          <p>12. Once you're at the login screen, click the "Ease of Access button." It should open the command prompt. Type "Netplwiz" and press enter. Click your username, click "Properties," click "Group Membership," then click "Administrator. Click "OK," "Apply," and then "OK" again, and just login normally.</p>
